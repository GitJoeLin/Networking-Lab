This program will allow you to connect to a server and interact with other users connected to the same server

First Step: Enter server IP Address

Second Step: Enter server port number and hit the "Connect" button or press enter

Third Step: When asked to enter a name, enter a valid name with characters ranging from a-z, A-Z, and 0-9, and press enter. If you enter an invalid name you will be asked to enter your name again.

Fourth Step: After connected to the server you will have access to a range of commands, press ENTER or RETURN on your keyboard to execute each command:

If you would like to send a message of your choice to everyone, simply type the message and press enter or hit the "Send" button. That will send that message to every user connected to the server.

"@ " followed by a name of a user, or multiple users separated by commas that are connected to the server, followed by a space, and then your message to that user, will send your message so that it is only visible to that user(s).

You will sometimes find a prompt saying that the first to type a word will get a cookie. To rack up your cookie numbers type "# " followed by the word that is asked for to get a cookie. You can type in "/leaderboards" or hit the "Leaderboards" button to show how many cookies each connected user has.

If you would like to see a list of all connected users, simply type in "/whoishere" or hit the "Show Users" button.

Typing "EXIT" or hitting the "Quit" button will disconnect you from the server
